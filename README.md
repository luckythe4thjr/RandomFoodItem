# RandomFoodItem
A progam that allows you to pick a random meal/food item if you can't decide. All you have to do is enter a food item, and it's category. Once you added as many meals you wish to pick from it will then use the random module to randomly pick one of the choices the database your meals, and categorys will be stored if you wish to use them again in the future.

> NOTE: This was my first ever Python project. All features I wish to add haven't been finished yet, but is currently fully functional.

**Uses**
Python;
- Built-in sqlite3 & random modules
